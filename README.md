# 🚀 DevTrack

**Prove your consistency. Map your growth. Master your craft.**

DevTrack is an AI-enhanced developer ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between learning and building. It provides a centralized platform to track learning streaks, analyze project progress via GitHub integration, and manage growth with intelligent insights.

## 🔥 Why DevTrack?

Traditional portfolios show where you _are_. DevTrack shows how you _got there_.

- **Insightful Tracking**: Log learning logs with mood and time metrics.
- **AI-Powered Project Intelligence**: Deep repository analysis using Llama 3.3 to identify **Security Vulnerabilities**, **Complexity Hotspots**, and generate **Actionable Next Steps**.
- **Action-Oriented Dashboard**: A smart interface that prioritizes critical "Warnings" (Security & Complexity) while keeping you forward-looking with "What Next" suggestions.
- **Consistency Engine**: GitHub commit streaks merged with learning streaks.
- **Intelligent Assistant**: Context-aware AI chat that knows your stack and progress.
